# About me

I am a frontend developer who is in love with open web and Javascript whether its **NodeJS** or **Browser**. Not that I don't like CSS and HTML but Javascript is my first love. Way back I use to do ActionScript which got me into EcmaScript I guess. Since then it has been a roller coaster ride.

In my recent avatar I was building mobile web and desktop web for [freecharge](https://freecharge.com). All this time working on NodeJS, VanillaJS, ReactJS etc. [Mobile site](https://freecharge.in/mobile) is just a beauty with no client side framework. Just running on NodeJS + Vanilla JS.

I do keep publishing things on my [Github](https://github.com/swapnilmishra) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/swapnil_mishra) whatever I feel excited about.

I am very excited about how web is evolving in terms of technologies and community. Few of the open source projects which excites me a lot these days are [Babel](https://github.com/babel), [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack) and [React](https://github.com/reactjs/).

Few of my projects on github are:

* [InstaLater](https://github.com/swapnilmishra/InstaLater) - A chrome plugin to save images, text and url while browsing the web.

* [JSbin clone](https://github.com/swapnilmishra/jsbin-jsbin-clone) - A simple JSBin clone to get an undersanding of how they work internally.

* [cache-javascript-localstorage](https://github.com/swapnilmishra/cache-javascript-localstorage) - A library to cache JS files in localStorage, supports cache bursting also. This was done way back when Service worker were still catching up so might not be relevant at this point of time.

* [Moviespotting](https://github.com/swapnilmishra/moviespotting) - A twitter like social network where in people would share which movie they are watching. Something on the lines of Goodreads for movies. Features like follow someone, likes, creating list is supported.
